# ToxicProgrammers
Too many toxic programmers exist. Too few really good ones exist. I took 30 years of harassment from one member and finally put my foot down. For that, despite others stating rightly that I am being provoked, one supposedly good developer has done the most Nazi thing possible. So be it. Let the games begin.
Furthermore I no longer tolerate "professional" programmers using childish, ridiculously stupid code and pretending it is good enough. That is not the path to producing good code.

If you think that is hateful, tough.
