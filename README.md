# ToxicProgrammers
Too many toxic programmers exist. Too few really good ones exist. I took 30 years of harassment from one member and finally put my foot down. For that, despite others stating rightly that I am being provoked, one supposedly good developer has done the most Nazi thing possible. So be it. Let the games begin.
Furthermore I call out "professional" programmers using childish, ridiculously stupid code and pretending it is good enough. That is not the path to producing good code.

A CRIMINAL act was done by one lady. She used privileged information due to her voluntering as a moderator and stole a respected developer's credentials to log into another site. She got fired, but not banned from the site. Another member, John Baird was banned for suggesting I had some part in HER CRIME. He should not have been punished. He should have been told the truth by the site owner and that lady should have been banned for life.

If you think that is hateful on my part, tough.
